This project is the final project of the computer science basics on The Odin Project. 
It's purpose was to learn the basic data structures and algorithms, in this case it was using a graph
and utilize breadth first traversal to find the target node (that is at least how i did it)

I learned a lot about grpahs, trees, linked lists and recursion, which was a (pun warning) reocurring 
theme in all the assignments. 

Now i will dive into the basics of TDD
